# PROBLEM:

# Given a string, write a method `palindrome_substrings` which returns
# all the substrings from a given string which are palindromes. Consider
# palindrome words case sensitive.

# Test cases:

# palindrome_substrings("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") == ["ili"]
# palindrome_substrings("abcddcbA") == ["bcddcb", "cddc", "dd"]
# palindrome_substrings("palindrome") == []
# palindrome_substrings("") == []

input: string
output: array of strings

rules:
  explicit: every substring that is a palindrome should be returned
            palindromes are case sensitive
            palindrome = string that reads the same forward and backward
  
  implicit: we are looking for substrings, not words. blanks don't matter.
            a palindrome can itself contain palindromes. both the outer and inner
              palindromes should be returned as separate strings in the array.
            when no palindrome is found, the returned array will be empty
            when the string is empty, the returned array will be empty
            can string contained spaces? If so, should spaces be considered characters
              for determining if a substring is a palindrome?
